        "The Uber Supply Demand Gap project explores discrepancies between rider demand and cab availability using data-driven analysis. The primary goal is to identify when and where Uber faces operational inefficiencies in fulfilling customer ride requests and to recommend solutions for optimizing driver supply based on these insights. The project integrates three major tools: Excel for data cleaning and dashboard creation, SQL for deriving analytical insights, and Python (Pandas) for performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).\n",
        "\n",
        "The dataset comprises ride request data, including attributes like request ID, pickup and drop-off points, timestamps, driver IDs, and ride statuses. Initially, data preprocessing was performed in Excel to clean the dataset by correcting timestamp formats, separating date and time components, and generating new variables such as the hour of the request and day of the week. This allowed for effective trend visualization and pattern recognition.\n",
        "\n",
        "One of the major observations from the dataset is the high frequency of ride cancellations and cab unavailability during specific times of the day. Through Excel dashboards, it became evident that the early morning (5 AM to 9 AM) and night hours (midnight to 4 AM) show a significant number of unfulfilled requests. A deeper look reveals that requests originating from the airport to the city during these hours are most likely to either be cancelled or result in the “no cab available” status.\n",
        "Using SQL queries, further insights were derived. Queries filtered ride statuses based on time intervals and pickup points. For instance, it was discovered that cancellation rates spike at airport pickups during early morning hours, while ride requests from the city during night hours are often not accepted due to the limited number of drivers online. These SQL-driven aggregations were instrumental in identifying patterns that pointed toward a clear mismatch between supply and demand.\n",
        "\n",
        "Python and Pandas were then used to complement these findings with advanced EDA. By grouping data based on request hour and status, and then plotting the distributions, it became obvious that there is a recurring shortage of drivers during non-peak but critical hours. Visualizations confirmed that despite a high number of ride requests, driver availability remains consistently low during night and early morning hours.\n",
        "\n",
        "The PowerPoint presentation of the project summarized these findings and offered data-backed recommendations. One key suggestion is to introduce incentives for drivers to operate during early morning hours, labeling it as a \"rush hour bonus\" to motivate them to accept more rides. Another suggestion is to formalize night shifts for drivers, which would ensure consistent cab availability during late hours, reducing instances where riders are left without transport options.\n",
        "\n",
        "In addition to operational strategies, the project underscores the importance of predictive scheduling. Using the observed trends, Uber could forecast high-demand time slots with historically low supply and accordingly nudge idle or part-time drivers to become active during those hours. This strategy could reduce cancellations, increase completed rides, and enhance overall customer satisfaction.\n",
        "\n",
        "In conclusion, this project successfully used Excel, SQL, and Python to uncover a persistent supply-demand gap in Uber services. The findings are rooted in time-based and location-specific analysis, highlighting Uber’s challenges in maintaining adequate driver availability during early morning and night periods. By implementing incentive programs and optimized driver scheduling, Uber can bridge this gap and improve service reliability. This project demonstrates how basic data analysis techniques can be leveraged to drive operational improvements and create actionable insights for real-world logistics and transportation systems.\n",

        "2. Critical Time-Based Service Gaps- Early morning (5 AM–9 AM) and late-night (12 AM–4 AM) hours show a noticeable spike in cancellations and \"No Cars Available\" status. Indicates a supply-demand mismatch during off-peak hours, possibly due to fewer active drivers.\n",

        "\n",
        "5. Driver Assignment Gaps- A large portion of requests have no driver assigned ('Blanks' or 'Unavailable'), especially for canceled or failed trips. Reinforces the need for proactive driver deployment during high-demand periods."
